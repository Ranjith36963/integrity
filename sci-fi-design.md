## Subject (pinned)

**Dharma is the command surface for a person constructing their life.** Each day is a building. Each brick is a habit logged. The user is not a customer — they're the **architect of an empire** they're building one day at a time.

The page's single job: show the user their day-in-progress and let them lay/log a brick in under 2 seconds.

The right sci-fi reference isn't cyberpunk (hostile, neon, chaotic). It's the calm command surfaces of **Foundation, Severance, Dune (Villeneuve), Interstellar's cockpit, and Apple Vision** — restrained, technical, optimistic. The signal is "you are running mission control on a beautiful machine."

---

## AI-default sci-fi clusters I'm REJECTING

1. **Cyberpunk neon** — cyan + magenta grids on black, Tron-style. Every AI sci-fi mock looks like this. Hostile, busy, dated.
2. **Matrix terminal** — green-on-black falling code. Lazy.
3. **Mass Effect HUD chrome** — corner brackets + targeting reticles + frame everything. Reads as a video game.
4. **Translucent glass everywhere** — every panel blurred and frosted. Apple Vision but cheap.

**Why I'm rejecting them**: they don't serve the subject (calm intentional habit-building). They're recognizable as "AI-generated sci-fi" within 0.5s.

## The signature (where I spend all boldness)

> The **Construction Reactor**: the hero ring becomes a live ambient signature.
> Three layers compose into one motif that lives on every screen.

**Layer 1 — the ring**: orbital data stream. The amber-filled arc is no longer static; subtle particle dashes flow along the stroke (think: stars orbiting at the Lagrange point of the % numeral). 1.5s rotation period. Slows when at-risk, accelerates briefly on each new brick logged.

**Layer 2 — the numeral**: the italic-serif `0%` / `50%` stays as-is in face + scale (this is sacred Dharma DNA), but gains a 1px tabular-numeric width-lock and a faint subpixel scan-shimmer when the value transitions.

**Layer 3 — ambient orbit particles**: 3-5 tiny amber motes circle the ring at varying radii, fading in/out. They're the user's "active bricks" — the bricks they've logged today are literally orbiting their own day.

**One sentence**: the hero becomes the small machine that is building the user's life, calmly, in front of them.

## Color — restrained palette (already 80% there, just escalating)

Current → Sci-fi 2036:

| Token             | Now       | Sci-fi 2036                           | Why                                                                                              |

| `--bg-elev`       | `#0c1018` | unchanged                             | Already correct — raised panel                                                                   |
| `--ink`           | `#f5f1e8` | unchanged                             | Off-white = "exposed bulb" not "office paper"                                                    |
| `--accent`        | `#fbbf24` | `#fbbf24` + **glow**                  | Amber stays. ADD `--accent-glow` and `--accent-bloom` for layered drop-shadows.                  |
| NEW `--ember`     | —         | `#f59e0b` → `#7c2d12` radial gradient | The "reactor core" radial behind hero                                                            |
| NEW `--scan`      | —         | `rgba(245, 241, 232, 0.014)`          | Body-overlay 2px horizontal scanlines, almost-invisible                                          |
| NEW `--data-cyan` | —         | `#67e8f9`                             | ONLY used on data-stream particles when a brick is mid-saving. NEVER large surfaces — restraint. |

**Total color count stays at ~7.** The sci-fi feel comes from the GLOW LAYERS on the same colors, not from adding new ones.

## Typography — surgically tighten

- **Display (Instrument Serif italic)**: kept — but with `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` so digits are tabular. No more digit width-jump when 0% → 10%.
- **UI (JetBrains Mono)**: kept — but bump `font-variation-settings` to slightly heavier tracking on tab labels for HUD feel.
- **NEW small numeric — `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums slashed-zero`**: applied to every numeric chip (insight cards, day counter, streak count, time labels). The slashed-zero is the small detail that screams "this is a terminal not a Word doc."
- **NEW callsign formatting**: instead of "Building 1 of 365," surface a system chip: `DAY ⌬ 001 / 365`. The `⌬` (Unicode U+232C "benzene ring") is the brick-stack glyph — recognizable, distinctive, monospace-aligned.

Microcopy reframe risk: changing the text "Building 1 of 365" breaks `BuildingClient.test.tsx` tests. Defer until tests are updated.

## Motion — disciplined, with one set piece

**Ambient (always-on, idle)**:

- Hero ring orbital dashes — 1.5s period, pure CSS `@keyframes` on `stroke-dashoffset`
- Scan-line overlay — 8s vertical drift, 1.4% opacity, near-imperceptible
- Body grid — slight `background-position` drift over 60s

**Trigger moments (rare, intentional)**:

- Brick log: amber particle scatter → coalesce into the new chip (450ms, framer)
- Day complete: timeline transforms into "skyline glow" sweep
- Sheet open: **iris transition** — `clip-path: circle()` morph from tap point to full screen (320ms)
- Sheet close: reverse iris back to tap origin
- Tab switch: ripple pulse from selected tab outward (200ms)

**One set piece (the bold moment)**:

- 100-day streak unlocks the "Empire Glimpse" — a 4-second cinematic where the timeline transforms into a glowing city skyline silhouette built from the user's actual blocks. Then collapses back. Once.

**Reduced-motion respected**: every ambient + trigger gets a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` no-op fallback. Already wired in globals.css.

---

## Layout — minimal changes (existing wireframe is right)

What I'm KEEPING:

- 430px mobile-first
- Top tab strip (Day/Week/Month/Year)
- Hero ring centered
- Timeline below, dock above bottom safe-area
- Settings + Welcome as sheets

What I'm ADDING:

- **System chip top-left**: `ARCHITECT ⌬ MON JUN 22` — replaces the plain `DHARMA` wordmark area with a tiny HUD status line. Optional. Phase 3.
- **Reactor core** behind hero ring — radial-gradient layer that glows brighter as % grows
- **Data-stream NowLine** — the amber horizontal line gets 3 amber motes traveling left-to-right, restarting every 8s. The "now" moves.

## Phased build plan

### Phase 1 — Atmosphere (~2h, ships now)

Foundation layer. Adds the ambient sci-fi feel without touching any feature logic.

1. New design tokens in `globals.css`:
   - `--accent-glow`, `--accent-bloom`, `--ember-core`, `--scan-tint`
2. Body scan-line overlay (fixed, near-invisible, animated drift)
3. Body grid + radial ember at hero region
4. `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums slashed-zero` on every numeric label
5. Reactor core radial behind hero ring
6. Ambient orbital particles around hero ring (CSS-only, 3 motes)

### Phase 2 — Hero signature (~3h)

7. Hero ring stroke-dasharray dashes that orbit
8. Data-stream particles on NowLine (3 amber motes flowing L→R, 8s loop)
9. Iris transition for Sheet open/close (replaces slide)
10. Tab switch ripple

### Phase 3 — Set pieces (~3h)

11. Brick log particle scatter → coalesce
12. Day-complete skyline sweep
13. 100-day streak "Empire Glimpse" cinematic
14. System chip + callsign formatting (with test updates)

## Quality floor (non-negotiable)

- Every animation has a `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` no-op
- Every new color passes WCAG AA contrast on `--bg`
- Tap targets stay ≥44×44
- No layout shift on first paint (skeleton handles it)
- Lifecycle audit (`npm run test:lifecycle`) stays at 0 anomalies
- Feature audit (`npm run test:audit`) stays at 42/42

_Phase 1 ships first. Each subsequent phase is its own commit with the
phase number in the message: `feat(scifi-phase-N): ...`_
