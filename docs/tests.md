## Pre-M0 Test Migration (94 IDs from the 8-feature pivot)

> The 94 test IDs from the previous empty-toolkit pivot are tagged below.
> [survives] = test stays valid as-is. [re-author] = same intent, new selectors/assertions for M0 tokens/components. [obsolete] = behaviour M0 doesn't ship; delete the test.
> Translated from `plan.md` § "Migration plan for the 94 pre-pivot test IDs". M0 itself does not delete or rewrite any of these tests; tagging is for M1+ planning.

## Page 1 — Building view — Tests (empty-toolkit pivot)

### wipe-demo

#### Component (Vitest + Testing Library)

- ID: C-bld-034
  GIVEN BuildingClient mounts with no localStorage
  WHEN page renders
  THEN blocks state is `[]` and EmptyBlocks copy ("No blocks yet. Tap + to add your first block.") is visible.
  Tested by: `app/(building)/BuildingClient.test.tsx`

- ID: C-bld-035
  GIVEN no blocks
  WHEN page renders
  THEN BlueprintBar is NOT in the DOM.
  Tested by: `app/(building)/BuildingClient.test.tsx`

- ID: C-bld-036
  GIVEN no blocks
  WHEN page renders
  THEN NowCard is NOT in the DOM.
  Tested by: `app/(building)/BuildingClient.test.tsx`

- ID: C-bld-037
  GIVEN no blocks
  WHEN Hero renders
  THEN AnimatedPercent target is `0`.
  Tested by: `components/Hero.test.tsx`

- ID: C-bld-038
  GIVEN Hero receives `dayNumber={undefined}`
  WHEN it renders
  THEN the "Building N of 365" line is not in the DOM.
  Tested by: `components/Hero.test.tsx`

#### E2E (Playwright)

- ID: E-bld-022
  GIVEN fresh page load
  WHEN visiting `/`
  THEN "No blocks yet. Tap + to add your first block." is visible.
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/empty.spec.ts`

- ID: E-bld-023
  GIVEN fresh page load
  WHEN visiting `/`
  THEN no `.now-glow` element exists.
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/empty.spec.ts`

- ID: E-bld-024
  GIVEN fresh page load
  WHEN visiting `/`
  THEN BottomBar Add button is visible and labeled (`aria-label="Add"`).
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/empty.spec.ts`

### live-clock

#### Unit (Vitest)

- ID: U-bld-022
  GIVEN `vi.setSystemTime(new Date("2026-04-29T11:47:00"))` and `useNow()` mounted in a test renderer
  WHEN the hook returns and `vi.advanceTimersByTime(60_000)` is called after the system time is bumped to `12:48`
  THEN the first render returns `"11:47"` and after the tick the value becomes `"12:48"`. The interval is cleared on unmount (a second advance after unmount produces no further state updates).
  Tested by: `lib/useNow.test.ts`

- ID: U-bld-023
  GIVEN a `Date` of `2026-04-29T11:47:00` (local)
  WHEN `today(d)` is called
  THEN result is the string `"2026-04-29"`. Also verify zero-padding: `today(new Date(2026, 0, 5))` returns `"2026-01-05"`.
  Tested by: `lib/dharma.test.ts`

- ID: U-bld-024
  GIVEN `programStart="2026-04-01"` and `today="2026-04-29"`
  WHEN `dayNumber(programStart, today)` is computed
  THEN result is `29`. AND `dayNumber(null, "2026-04-29")` returns `undefined`; `dayNumber("", "2026-04-29")` returns `undefined`; `dayNumber("2026-04-29", "2026-04-29")` returns `1`.
  Tested by: `lib/dharma.test.ts`

- ID: U-bld-025
  GIVEN `today="2026-04-29"`
  WHEN `dateLabel(today)` is called
  THEN result is `"Wed, Apr 29"` (locale fixed to `en-US`, format `weekday:"short", month:"short", day:"numeric"` per SG-bld-11). Also verify `dateLabel("2026-01-05")` returns `"Mon, Jan 5"` (no leading zero on day).
  Tested by: `lib/dharma.test.ts`

#### Component (Vitest + Testing Library)

- ID: C-bld-039
  GIVEN `vi.setSystemTime(new Date("2026-04-29T11:47:00"))` and `BuildingClient` rendered
  WHEN the page mounts
  THEN the Hero shows the live `dateLabel` `"Wed, Apr 29"` (NOT the `wipe-demo` placeholder `""`) and the BlueprintBar's NOW pin reflects `"11:47"` (NOT `"00:00"`).
  Tested by: `app/(building)/BuildingClient.test.tsx`

- ID: C-bld-040
  GIVEN `vi.setSystemTime(new Date("2026-04-29T11:47:00"))` and `BuildingClient` rendered with the placeholder `programStart = today()`
  WHEN the Hero renders
  THEN the visible text includes `"Building 1 of 365"` (since `programStart === today` → `dayNumber === 1`). This proves the Hero's day-counter line renders when `dayNumber` is defined, and verifies the placeholder behaviour documented in the plan.
  Tested by: `app/(building)/BuildingClient.test.tsx`

#### Spec gaps

- SG-bld-11 — `dateLabel` format. Spec § "UX Spec — Phase 1 Toolkit" does not specify locale, 12h vs 24h, or weekday-comma style. **Resolution (user approved 2026-05-01):** fixed `en-US` locale, `Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", { weekday: "short", month: "short", day: "numeric" })` → `"Wed, Apr 29"`. Time format already fixed at 24h `HH:MM` by `lib/data.ts` precedent and SG-bld-10. If the user later wants locale-aware labels, that's a follow-up feature; tests assert the `en-US` output today.

### Migration of demo-build IDs (started — wipe-demo pass)

After wipe-demo, these existing IDs are obsolete (delete the test files that contain them, or mark `it.skip` with a "Replaced by wipe-demo" comment):

- U-bld-016 [obsolete: BLOCKS constant gone]
- U-bld-017 [obsolete: BLOCKS constant gone]
- U-bld-018 [obsolete: BLOCKS constant gone]
- C-bld-008 / C-bld-009 / C-bld-010 / C-bld-011 [obsolete: BlueprintBar tests against demo BLOCKS]
- C-bld-012 / C-bld-013 [obsolete: NowCard tests against demo "Work block"]
- C-bld-014 / C-bld-015 / C-bld-017 / C-bld-018 [obsolete: TimelineBlock tests against demo blocks]
- E-bld-002 [obsolete: Hero=57 only true for demo fixture]
- E-bld-004..007, E-bld-014, E-bld-019 [obsolete: assert demo block content]

(Other migration tags will be added as later features land. This file is append-only across features.)

### Spec gaps — resolved

User approved all 10 gaps as proposed by the planner on 2026-04-29. Builder must implement the **Resolution** for each.

- SG-bld-01 — Edit-mode `×` icon affordance.
  **Resolution:** `×` is always visible in edit mode (no swipe gesture in Page 1 scope).
- SG-bld-02 — Time-brick logging UX in view mode.
  **Resolution:** `+/-` stepper for Phase 1 — same component as Goal. No real timer.
- SG-bld-03 — NOW pin position semantics.
  **Resolution:** half-open `[start, end)` intervals (matches current `currentBlockIndex`).
- SG-bld-04 — Empty-state E2E reachability.
  **Resolution:** **drop E-bld-021**; rely on `C-bld-016` for empty-blocks coverage. Builder must mark E-bld-021 as `// dropped per SG-bld-04` in any e2e file rather than implementing it.
- SG-bld-05 — Top bar Settings button.
  **Resolution:** stays a no-op for Page 1. Render the icon button; do not wire a handler.
- SG-bld-06 — Voice Log button.
  **Resolution:** stays a no-op for Page 1 (parse behavior is Phase 1.5).
- SG-bld-07 — Hero `%` rounding.
  **Resolution:** `Math.round` to integer. Never shows decimals.
- SG-bld-08 — Equal-weight `dayPct`.
  **Resolution:** **fix** `lib/dharma.ts::dayPct` to a simple mean of `blockPct`. The Hero number changes (~26% → ~57%) — this is intentional, not a regression. Update `lib/dharma.test.ts` to match.
- SG-bld-09 — Brick stagger fade-in scope.
  **Resolution:** stagger applies **only to bricks**, using the existing `brick-in` class with `index * 35ms` delay. Do not stagger blocks/cards/sections.
- SG-bld-10 — Date label format.
  **Resolution:** keep the existing literal `Wed, Apr 29` from `lib/data.ts::TODAY_LABEL`.

## Milestone 0 — Design System — Tests

> Every ID below traces to `plan.md` § "Milestone 0 — Design System — Plan". The `Proves:` line names the plan section the test verifies, so EVALUATOR's spec-coverage check is mechanical.
> ID series start fresh from `001` per layer (`U-m0-*`, `C-m0-*`, `E-m0-*`, `A-m0-*`). Pre-pivot `*-bld-*` IDs continue to live above; M0 does not delete or renumber them (see migration table at top of file).

### E2E (Playwright)

> All M0 e2e run on `mobile-chrome` (Pixel 7) only per ADR-010 (mobile-safari disabled in this sandbox). Base URL `http://localhost:3000`. Harness route: `/_design`.

- ID: E-m0-001
  GIVEN the dev server is running
  WHEN visiting `/_design`
  THEN the page responds 200, `[data-testid="design-harness"]` is in the DOM, and the visible content max-width is ≤430 CSS px.
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § File structure — `app/_design/page.tsx` + Edge case 2

- ID: E-m0-002
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded
  WHEN the page is inspected
  THEN exactly one of each of the 10 primitives is rendered with its `data-testid`: `button`, `modal-trigger`, `sheet-trigger`, `chip`, `input`, `stepper`, `toggle`, `empty-state`, `block-card`, `brick-chip` (each name appears at least once; trigger buttons stand in for portal-based primitives).
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § File structure — harness renders every primitive

- ID: E-m0-003
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded
  WHEN the bounding box of every interactive element (`button, [role="button"], [role="switch"], input, [data-testid="brick-chip"], [data-testid="chip"]`) is measured
  THEN every box has `width >= 44` and `height >= 44` (CSS pixels).
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Edge case 2 — 44px touch targets

- ID: E-m0-004
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded with the browser context emulating `prefersReducedMotion: "reduce"`
  WHEN any motion-tagged element (`[data-motion]`) is inspected
  THEN computed `animation-name` is `none` (or `transition-duration` resolves to `0s`); the EmptyState pulse element has no running animation; and the Modal open transition completes within 50ms.
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Edge case 1 + § Design tokens — reduced-motion collapse rule

- ID: E-m0-005
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded
  WHEN the body's computed `font-family` is read
  THEN it begins with the Geist Sans family token (matches `/Geist|var\(--font-geist-sans\)/`) and falls back to a system UI family. The page does not exhibit FOIT (no element has `visibility: hidden` waiting on a font load — `font-display: swap` per `next/font`).
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Edge case 7 — Font loading

- ID: E-m0-006
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded at viewport 430×844
  WHEN the user opens the `<Modal>` via its trigger
  THEN the modal's bottom inset (computed `padding-bottom`) is ≥ `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` value (or at least `0px` resolved, with the rule referencing `var(--safe-bottom)` in source). The CTA button inside the modal has its bottom edge at least `var(--safe-bottom)` above the viewport bottom.
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Edge case 6 — Modal/Sheet on iOS Safari

- ID: E-m0-007
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded
  WHEN the browser console is observed during page load and basic interaction (open/close modal, toggle Toggle, +/- stepper)
  THEN there are zero console errors and zero unhandled promise rejections.
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Components — all primitives render cleanly (Quality Gate: "No console errors")

- ID: E-m0-008
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded
  WHEN `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--bg')` is read
  THEN it equals `#07090f`. Same for `--ink` (`#f5f1e8`), `--accent` (`#fbbf24`), and `--cat-passive` (`#64748b`).

### Accessibility (axe via Playwright)

- ID: A-m0-001
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded
  WHEN `@axe-core/playwright` runs against the full page
  THEN there are zero violations of severity `serious` or `critical`.
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.a11y.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Edge case 3 — Token contrast on `#07090f` + Acceptance criteria

- ID: A-m0-002
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded
  WHEN axe is configured with only the `color-contrast` rule and run against text using `--ink` and `--ink-dim` over `--bg`/`--bg-elev`
  THEN there are zero violations. (Plan.md asserts ~17.5:1 for `--ink` and ~8.7:1 for `--ink-dim` on `#07090f` — both pass WCAG AA.)
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.a11y.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Edge case 3 — WCAG AA contrast (ADR-011)

- ID: A-m0-003
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded
  WHEN every `<button>`, `[role="button"]`, and `[role="switch"]` is enumerated
  THEN each has a non-empty accessible name (text content OR `aria-label` OR `aria-labelledby`).
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.a11y.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Components — all interactive primitives expose accessible names

- ID: A-m0-004
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded
  WHEN `Tab` is pressed repeatedly to traverse focusable elements
  THEN every interactive primitive in the harness is reached, the focused element shows a visible focus ring (computed `outline-style !== "none"` OR `box-shadow` contains a focus-ring token), and tab order is the document source order.
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.a11y.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Components — focus management (Quality Gate: a11y 100)

- ID: A-m0-005
  GIVEN `/_design` is loaded with the `<Modal>` open
  WHEN axe runs again
  THEN there are zero new violations introduced by the open dialog (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, focus trapped inside the modal, ESC closes).
  Tested by: `tests/e2e/design.a11y.spec.ts`
  Proves: plan.md § Components — `<Modal>` (a11y semantics)

### Spec gaps

- **None blocking.** Plan.md M0 is internally consistent; every Component, Edge case, and Acceptance criterion has at least one test ID above.
- **Note (deferred audit, not an M0 gap):** the migration table flags `A-bld-001..005` and `C-bld-001..010` for re-author at M1 because of the `--bg` re-base. M0's `A-m0-*` tests cover the new harness page only; if axe flags a regression on the legacy Page 1 surface when run there, that is an M1 dispatch concern.
- **Note (not a gap):** plan.md mentions a contrast-pair table at the bottom of the harness page rendered with raw `style={{ color, background }}`. `A-m0-001` runs axe across the whole page and therefore includes that table; no separate ID needed.
