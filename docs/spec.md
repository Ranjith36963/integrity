## UX Spec — Phase 1 Toolkit

### Mental Model

Routines = recurring calendar events.
Same feel as Google Calendar.

### Terms

- Brick = smallest action item
- Block = time slot containing bricks
- Building = day
- Castle = week
- Kingdom = month
- Empire = year

### Edit Mode Toggle

Top right. Pencil icon.

- Locked (default) = view only. Tap blocks to log bricks.
- Unlocked = edit. Drag, delete, add.
  Stops accidental edits during the day.

### Add a Block

Two ways:

1. Tap empty time slot in timeline
2. Tap floating + button (bottom right)

Modal opens:

- Name (text)
- Start time (defaults to tapped slot)
- End time
- Category (Health / Mind / Career / Passive)
- Save button

After save, recurrence prompt:

- Just today
- Every Monday (or whichever weekday it is)
- Every weekday (Mon–Fri)
- Every day
- Custom range...

### Add a Brick

Tap a block → block detail opens.
"+ Add brick" button inside.

Modal:

- Name (text)
- Type (Tick / Goal / Time)
- If Goal → target number + unit (e.g. 100 reps)
- If Time → target minutes (e.g. 30 min)
- Save

Brick appears in block.

### Edit a Block

Edit mode on → tap block → modal opens with current values → change → save.

### Delete a Block

Edit mode on → swipe left on block OR tap × icon.
Confirmation prompt: "Delete this block? Just today / All recurrences"

### Delete a Brick

Edit mode on → swipe left on brick OR tap × icon.
Same confirmation prompt.

### Reorder Blocks

Edit mode on → long-press → drag.
Times auto-adjust OR snap to grid (TBD).

### Reorder Bricks

Edit mode on → drag handle on brick → drag.

### Copy a Building (day)

Long-press day header → menu:

- Copy Building
- Paste Building to date(s)
- Apply Building to range

"Apply Building to range":

- Mon–Fri
- Whole week
- This month
- Custom range (e.g. April 29 → December 31, 2026)

All blocks + bricks copy to all selected days.

### Copy a Castle (week)

Week view → long-press week header → "Apply Castle to range"
Same flow as Building.

### Recurrence Editing (Google Calendar style)

When user edits a recurring block, prompt:

- This event only
- This and following events
- All events in series

### Voice Log (Phase 1.5)

Floating mic button (bottom, primary).
Tap → speak → Claude API parses → fills bricks → auto-scores.

### Empty States

- Empty day → "No blocks yet. Tap + to add your first block."
- Empty block → "No bricks yet. Tap + to add a brick."
- Empty week → "Copy a Building to fill the week."

### Logging Bricks (View Mode)

Block expanded → tap brick:

- Tick → toggles 0/100
- Goal → number input or +/- stepper
- Time → start/stop timer OR manual input
  Block % updates live as bricks log.

### Save Modes (recurring edits)

Like Google Calendar:

- Apply to template = permanent (every Monday gets it)
- Apply to today only = one-time

### Categories

- Health (#34d399)
- Mind (#c4b5fd)
- Career (#fbbf24)
- Passive (#64748b)

### Scoring (math)

Tick brick: 0 or 100
Goal brick: (done ÷ target) × 100, capped at 100
Time brick: (mins done ÷ mins target) × 100, capped at 100

Block % = average of all brick %
Building % = average of all block %
Castle % = average of 7 Buildings
Kingdom % = average of 4 Castles
Empire % = average of 12 Kingdoms

All equal weight.

### Animations

- Brick fills with smooth gradient as it scores
- Scaffold rises bottom-up as block completes
- Building grows live as day progresses
- Pulsing glow on current block
- Stagger fade-in on page load
- Hero % counts up over 1.6s on load

### Mobile Constraints

- Max width 430px (iPhone Pro Max)
- Touch targets ≥ 44px
- One-handed reach for primary actions
- Bottom-anchored floating buttons.
