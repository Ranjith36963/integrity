# Dharma — Product Spec

> **Status:** placeholder. The user will paste the full Dharma spec. Until then, agents must STOP and report a spec gap rather than proceed.

## How to use this document

This file is the **source of truth** for what Dharma does. The PLANNER reads this; no other agent does.

Each feature/page in this document should follow this skeleton:

```
## <Feature or page name>

### Purpose
One sentence on why this exists.

### Users / context
Who uses it, when, on what device.

### Acceptance criteria
Numbered, observable, testable. Each criterion becomes one or more G/W/T assertions in /docs/tests.md.

1. <criterion>
2. <criterion>
...

### Visual design
Layout, tokens, motion, sizing. Reference globals.css tokens where possible.

### Data
What data is read/written. Persistence model.

### Out of scope

## UX Spec — Phase 1 Toolkit

### Mental Model

Routines = recurring calendar events.
Same feel as Google Calendar.

### Terms

- Brick = smallest action item
- Block = time slot containing bricks
- Building = day
- Castle = week
- Kingdom = month
- Empire = year

### Edit Mode Toggle

Top right. Pencil icon.

- Locked (default) = view only. Tap blocks to log bricks.
- Unlocked = edit. Drag, delete, add.
  Stops accidental edits during the day.

### Add a Block

Two ways:

1. Tap empty time slot in timeline
2. Tap floating + button (bottom right)

Modal opens:

- Name (text)
- Start time (defaults to tapped slot)
- End time
- Category (Health / Mind / Career / Passive)
- Save button

After save, recurrence prompt:

- Just today
- Every Monday (or whichever weekday it is)
- Every weekday (Mon–Fri)
- Every day
- Custom range...

### Add a Brick

Tap a block → block detail opens.
"+ Add brick" button inside.

Modal:

- Name (text)
- Type (Tick / Goal / Time)
- If Goal → target number + unit (e.g. 100 reps)
- If Time → target minutes (e.g. 30 min)
- Save

Brick appears in block.

### Edit a Block

Edit mode on → tap block → modal opens with current values → change → save.

### Delete a Block

Edit mode on → swipe left on block OR tap × icon.
Confirmation prompt: "Delete this block? Just today / All recurrences"

### Delete a Brick

Edit mode on → swipe left on brick OR tap × icon.
Same confirmation prompt.

### Reorder Blocks

Edit mode on → long-press → drag.
Times auto-adjust OR snap to grid (TBD).

### Reorder Bricks

Edit mode on → drag handle on brick → drag.

### Copy a Building (day)

Long-press day header → menu:

- Copy Building
- Paste Building to date(s)
- Apply Building to range

"Apply Building to range":

- Mon–Fri
- Whole week
- This month
- Custom range (e.g. April 29 → December 31, 2026)

All blocks + bricks copy to all selected days.

### Copy a Castle (week)

Week view → long-press week header → "Apply Castle to range"
Same flow as Building.

### Recurrence Editing (Google Calendar style)

When user edits a recurring block, prompt:

- This event only
- This and following events
- All events in series

### Voice Log (Phase 1.5)

Floating mic button (bottom, primary).
Tap → speak → Claude API parses → fills bricks → auto-scores.

### Empty States

- Empty day → "No blocks yet. Tap + to add your first block."
- Empty block → "No bricks yet. Tap + to add a brick."
- Empty week → "Copy a Building to fill the week."

### Logging Bricks (View Mode)

Block expanded → tap brick:

- Tick → toggles 0/100
- Goal → number input or +/- stepper
- Time → start/stop timer OR manual input
  Block % updates live as bricks log.

### Save Modes (recurring edits)

Like Google Calendar:

- Apply to template = permanent (every Monday gets it)
- Apply to today only = one-time

### Categories

- Health (#34d399)
- Mind (#c4b5fd)
- Career (#fbbf24)
- Passive (#64748b)

### Scoring (math)

Tick brick: 0 or 100
Goal brick: (done ÷ target) × 100, capped at 100
Time brick: (mins done ÷ mins target) × 100, capped at 100

Block % = average of all brick %
Building % = average of all block %
Castle % = average of 7 Buildings
Kingdom % = average of 4 Castles
Empire % = average of 12 Kingdoms

All equal weight.

### Animations

- Brick fills with smooth gradient as it scores
- Scaffold rises bottom-up as block completes
- Building grows live as day progresses
- Pulsing glow on current block
- Stagger fade-in on page load
- Hero % counts up over 1.6s on load

### Mobile Constraints

- Max width 430px (iPhone Pro Max)
- Touch targets ≥ 44px
- One-handed reach for primary actions
- Bottom-anchored floating buttons.

## Milestone 0 — Design System

### Intent

Build the foundation. Tokens + 10 primitives + motion vocab.

This ships before any feature. Every later milestone composes from these primitives. No reinvention. No drift.

This is what stops Dharma looking like AI slop. Locked aesthetic. Sharp. Distinctive.

### Inputs

**Tokens**

- Colors: `--bg`, `--bg-elev`, `--ink`, `--ink-dim`, `--accent`, `--accent-deep`, 4 category colors
- Typography: Instrument Serif Italic (display) + JetBrains Mono (UI) + Geist Sans (body)
- Type scale: 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 22 / 32 / 64
- Spacing: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48
- Motion: tap, brick fill, block bloom, modal open/close, FLIP, long-press, stagger
- Haptics: light / medium / success / notification

**Primitives (10)**

1. `<Button>` — primary (amber), secondary (outline), ghost
2. `<Modal>` — bottom sheet, spring open
3. `<Sheet>` — full-screen for forms
4. `<Chip>` — categories, recurrence
5. `<Input>` — text, time, number
6. `<Stepper>` — +/- with momentum on long-press
7. `<Toggle>` — edit mode lock/unlock
8. `<EmptyState>` — pulsing card
9. `<BlockCard>` — block container variant
10. `<BrickChip>` — 3 sub-variants: tick / goal / time

**Constraints**

- WCAG AA contrast on dark bg
- Mobile-first, max-width 430px
- Touch targets ≥ 44px
- Dark mode only
- Framer Motion (layout enabled) for all motion
- Reduced motion respected globally

### Outputs

- `/app/_design/page.tsx` — primitives harness page rendering all 10 primitives in every state
- `/app/globals.css` — CSS variables for every token
- `/app/layout.tsx` — `next/font` wiring for Instrument Serif Italic + JetBrains Mono + Geist Sans
- `/lib/motion.ts` — motion tokens (durations, easings, spring configs)
- `/lib/haptics.ts` — haptic helper with iOS/Android fallback
- `/components/ui/*` — 10 primitive components, exported
- `/components/ui/index.ts` — barrel export
- Storybook-style states: default, hover, active, disabled, loading, empty, error (where applicable)
- axe-clean output across the harness page (zero violations)
- Lighthouse a11y score 100 on harness page

### Edge cases

- **prefers-reduced-motion** → all motion tokens collapse to instant transitions; FLIP becomes hard-cut; bloom becomes static glow
- **430px viewport** → every touch target ≥ 44px; primary actions reachable one-handed (bottom-anchored)
- **Token contrast** → `--ink-dim` (`rgba(245,241,232,.5)`) on `#07090f` bg passes WCAG AA for body text; verified with axe
- **Empty / loading / error states** → every primitive that holds data has all 3
- **Long-press accelerator on Stepper** → caps at 10x speed to prevent runaway
- **Modal/Sheet on iOS Safari** → respects safe-area insets (bottom notch)
- **Font loading** → swap fallback (Geist → system UI) prevents FOIT
- **Haptics on iOS PWA** → graceful fallback (silent no-op on unsupported)
- **Dark mode only** → light-mode tokens not defined; document why in design system README

### Acceptance criteria

- All 10 primitives render on `/app/_design/page.tsx` with every documented state
- CSS variables defined for every token in spec
- Fonts load without FOIT/FOUT
- axe-clean (zero violations) on harness page
- Lighthouse a11y = 100 on harness page
- 60fps scroll on iPhone 12+ (verified via Playwright trace)
- prefers-reduced-motion honored across all primitives
- Touch targets ≥ 44px verified by Playwright pixel-measurement test
- TypeScript strict, zero errors
- ESLint zero warnings
- All Vitest unit tests for primitives pass
- All Playwright e2e tests for harness page pass
- README in `/components/ui/README.md` documents each primitive: props, variants, when to use, when not to use
