## Page 1 — Building view — Plan (empty-toolkit pivot)

### wipe-demo

**Context.** The empty-toolkit pivot makes user-created routines the default. Today, `lib/data.ts` ships a hardcoded 16-block weekday demo that masks the real first-run experience; this feature deletes the demo so the app boots into `EmptyBlocks` and Hero shows 0%. Persistence, live clock, and modals come in later dispatches per ADR-022.

**Files modified:**

- `lib/data.ts` — Delete `BLOCKS`, `NOW`, `DAY_NUMBER`, `TOTAL_DAYS`, `TODAY_LABEL` constants. Replace with a `defaultState()` factory that returns the empty `AppState` shape per ADR-018: `{ schemaVersion: 1, programStart: "", blocks: [], logs: {}, timers: {}, deletions: {} }`. The factory is exported but not yet wired to localStorage (that is the `persist` feature). Imports of the deleted constants must move to local placeholders inside `BuildingClient` for this feature only.
- `lib/types.ts` — Add `id: string` to both `Block` and `Brick` per the ADR-018 schema. Keep all existing fields (`start`, `end`, `name`, `category`, `bricks` on `Block`; `kind`, `name`, etc. on `Brick`) — later features will refine. The `id` is a plain string; uuid generation is the `add-block` / `add-brick` features' problem, not this one.
- `app/(building)/BuildingClient.tsx` — Initialize `const [blocks, setBlocks] = useState<Block[]>([])`. Remove the `BLOCKS` import. Remove `NOW`, `DAY_NUMBER`, `TOTAL_DAYS`, `TODAY_LABEL` imports. Replace each with a local placeholder constant inside the component (e.g. `const now = "00:00"`, `const dayNumber = undefined`, `const totalDays = 365`, `const dateLabel = ""`) — `live-clock` will replace these with derived values per ADR-020. `dayNumber` MUST be passed as `undefined` so Hero hides the day-counter line.
- `components/Hero.tsx` — Change `dayNumber` prop to optional (`dayNumber?: number`). When `dayNumber === undefined`, do NOT render the "Building N of 365" line at all (omit the JSX node, not just hide via CSS). When defined, render exactly as before.

**Verification (no refactor):**

- `BlueprintBar` is already conditionally rendered when `blocks.length > 0` — verify the conditional is still in place after the data wipe; do not refactor.
- `NowCard` is already conditionally rendered when a current block exists — verify; do not refactor.
- `Timeline` already shows `EmptyBlocks` when `blocks.length === 0` — verify the empty copy "No blocks yet. Tap + to add your first block." renders.

**Edge cases:** The empty path (Timeline → EmptyBlocks) is already wired from the prior Page 1 build. Hero must accept `pct={0}` without crashing or showing a negative tween value. `AnimatedPercent` already handles 0 correctly.

**Out of scope (this feature):** localStorage / hydration (`persist`), `useNow()` and live `dayNumber` derivation (`live-clock`), Add Block / Add Brick modals (`add-block`, `add-brick`), recurrence evaluation (`recurrence`), real `BrickTimer` (`brick-timer`), program-start flow.

### live-clock

**Context.** Per ADR-020, `now`, `today`, `dateLabel`, and `dayNumber` must be derived live from `Date()`, not constants. This feature replaces the `wipe-demo` placeholder values in `BuildingClient.tsx` with live derivations so the Hero shows the user's real clock and date. `programStart` persistence is deferred to the `persist` feature; this feature uses a local placeholder (`programStart = today()`) so `dayNumber === 1` until `persist` lands.

**Files added/modified:**

- `lib/useNow.ts` — **new**. `"use client"` React hook. Returns the current `HH:MM` string from `new Date()`. Subscribes to a 60s `setInterval` that calls `setState(formatHHMM(new Date()))`; cleans up on unmount. Does NOT respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for tick suppression — accessibility requires that displayed time information stay current. Animation-level reduced-motion is handled elsewhere (`AnimatedPercent`). Initial value computed from `new Date()` on mount; SSR-safe by returning `""` (or formatting the server-side `Date()`) on first render and updating after mount — the builder picks one and documents it.
- `lib/dharma.ts` — **add three pure helpers** (export named, no runtime side-effects, no Date inside default-args; the caller passes the Date or string in):
  - `today(d: Date = new Date()): string` — returns local-date ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` (use `d.getFullYear()`, `d.getMonth()+1`, `d.getDate()`, zero-padded). NOT UTC.
  - `dayNumber(programStart: string | null | undefined, today: string): number | undefined` — returns `floor((today - programStart) / 1d) + 1`. Returns `undefined` if `programStart` is null, undefined, or empty string. Implementation parses both ISO strings as local-midnight `Date` and divides by `86_400_000`.
  - `dateLabel(today: string): string` — returns `"Wed, Apr 29"` style. Format chosen: `Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", { weekday: "short", month: "short", day: "numeric" }).format(d)`. The result reads as `"Wed, Apr 29"` (comma after weekday, no leading zero on day). Document the fixed `en-US` locale in code comments — see SG-bld-11.
- `app/(building)/BuildingClient.tsx` — replace the `wipe-demo` placeholder constants:
  - `const now = useNow();` (replaces `const now = "00:00"`)
  - `const todayIso = today();` (new local)
  - `const programStart = todayIso;` (placeholder; the `persist` feature will replace this with the persisted value loaded from `localStorage`. Add a `// TODO(persist): load from AppState` comment.)
  - `const dayNumberValue = dayNumber(programStart, todayIso);` (replaces `const dayNumber = undefined`)
  - `const dateLabelValue = dateLabel(todayIso);` (replaces `const dateLabel = ""`)
  - Imports: `import { useNow } from "@/lib/useNow"`; `import { today, dayNumber, dateLabel } from "@/lib/dharma"`. Use renamed locals (`dayNumberValue`, `dateLabelValue`, `todayIso`) to avoid shadowing the imported helpers.
  - Pass `now={now}`, `dateLabel={dateLabelValue}`, `dayNumber={dayNumberValue}` to `<Hero>` and `<BlueprintBar>` as before. Hero will now render `"Building 1 of 365"` (because `programStart === today` → dayNumber=1).
- `components/Hero.tsx` — no behavioural change (already accepts `dayNumber` as optional from `wipe-demo`). Verify it renders `"Building 1 of 365"` when `dayNumber=1`.

**Edge cases.**

- **Midnight roll-over.** If the user keeps the page open across midnight, `useNow` ticks every 60s and triggers a re-render; on the next render `today()` returns the new ISO date and `dateLabel` updates. There is up to a 60s lag — acceptable for Phase 1.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`.** Time/date updates are NOT suppressed. Reduced-motion only governs animation; the displayed clock value must stay current for accessibility (WCAG-aligned).
- **DST transition.** `today()` uses local-date components, so the day boundary stays consistent regardless of DST shifts. `dayNumber` math uses local-midnight Dates parsed from ISO strings, so a 23-hour or 25-hour DST day still produces the correct integer day delta.
- **`programStart` empty string.** `dayNumber("", today)` returns `undefined` — Hero hides the day-counter line.
- **Tests must inject a controlled clock.** Use `vi.useFakeTimers()` + `vi.setSystemTime(new Date("2026-04-29T11:47:00"))` for unit/component tests. Playwright tests are not retro-fitted in this feature — e2e clock injection is `persist`'s problem.

**Out of scope (this feature):** Persisting `programStart` to localStorage (`persist`). Wiring NowCard's pulsing dot to live `now` for current-block detection (no current block in empty state — defer until blocks exist). Reduced-motion for `AnimatedPercent` (already handled). E2E clock injection (deferred).

### Context

Page 1 is the at-a-glance daily routine surface — the only screen in Phase 1 that a user opens to "build today". It already exists in committed form (rendered by `app/page.tsx`) but predates the spec; this plan codifies what the spec demands so the builder can close the deltas test-first. Everything is read from the hardcoded sample in `lib/data.ts` (`NOW = "11:47"`, `DAY_NUMBER = 119`, weekday routine of 16 blocks); persistence and modals are out of scope for this feature.

### File structure

Create:

- `lib/scoring.ts` — pure scoring helpers (`buildingPct`) extracted/clarified per spec. Re-export existing `brickPct` / `blockPct` for a single import surface. (Avoid editing `lib/dharma.ts` semantics for `brickPct`/`blockPct`; only fix `dayPct` — see below.)
- `lib/scoring.test.ts` — unit tests for `buildingPct` and equal-weight semantics.
- `components/EditModeProvider.tsx` — `"use client"` React Context provider exposing `{ editMode: boolean; toggle(): void }`. Wraps the page client tree.
- `components/EditModeProvider.test.tsx` — provider unit tests.
- `app/(building)/BuildingClient.tsx` — `"use client"` wrapper that holds the brick-log mutable state (`blocks` from `lib/data.ts` cloned into `useState`), the `EditModeProvider`, and renders TopBar / Hero / BlueprintBar / NowCard / Timeline / BottomBar. Page 1 needs interactivity, so the page becomes a server-shell that mounts this client.
- `components/BrickStepper.tsx` — `"use client"` inline +/− stepper used by Goal and Time bricks in view mode.
- `components/EmptyBlocks.tsx` — empty-state copy when `blocks.length === 0`.
- `components/EmptyBricks.tsx` — empty-state copy when a block has `bricks.length === 0`.
- `tests/e2e/building.spec.ts` — Playwright e2e for Page 1.
- `tests/e2e/building.a11y.spec.ts` — `@axe-core/playwright` accessibility check.
- Component test files: `components/TopBar.test.tsx`, `components/Hero.test.tsx`, `components/BlueprintBar.test.tsx`, `components/NowCard.test.tsx`, `components/Timeline.test.tsx`, `components/TimelineBlock.test.tsx`, `components/Brick.test.tsx`, `components/Scaffold.test.tsx`, `components/BottomBar.test.tsx`, `components/AnimatedPercent.test.tsx`.

Modify:

- `lib/dharma.ts`
  - **Fix** `dayPct(blocks)` to be the **equal-weighted average of `blockPct`** (spec §Scoring: "All equal weight"). Current code is duration-weighted, which is a spec violation.
  - Add `buildingPct(blocks)` as an alias re-exported from `lib/scoring.ts` if extraction approach is preferred; otherwise keep `dayPct` as the canonical name and document the rename inside `lib/scoring.ts` re-export.
  - No other behaviour changes.
- `lib/dharma.test.ts` — add equal-weight expectations; existing tests stay green.
- `lib/data.ts` — convert `BLOCKS` to a `let` exported as a named const **but** keep value identical. Builder must not mutate the export; the client clones into local state on mount. (No structural change required if the builder chooses to clone in the client — leave as `const` and clone.)
- `app/page.tsx` — render the new `BuildingClient` instead of composing components directly. Must remain a server component.
- `components/TopBar.tsx` — add `aria-pressed` / data attribute for edit mode; consume `EditModeProvider`. Convert to client component (`"use client"`) because it must hook into context for the toggle.
- `components/TimelineBlock.tsx` — accept `onLogBrick` callback, add `data-testid="timeline-block"`, `data-status="past|current|future"`, render an `×` delete affordance per block when `editMode` is on (no-op handler — modal is out of scope; the icon must be present and have `aria-label="Delete block"`). Pass `editMode` down to bricks.
- `components/Brick.tsx` — accept `editMode` and `onLog` callbacks. In view mode, the entire brick is a `<button>` (so it has the 44px+ tap target after styling). In edit mode, surfaces an `×` button with `aria-label="Delete brick"`. For Tick: tap toggles `done`. For Goal/Time: tap opens an inline `BrickStepper` (popover anchored to the brick) that allows incrementing `current` and committing. Block % must update live from the parent's state.
- `components/NowCard.tsx` — accept `block` and `onLogBrick` callback; same brick-tap behaviour as Timeline. The pulsing dot + amber glow must be preserved.
- `components/BlueprintBar.tsx` — add `aria-label` describing block + use `data-testid="blueprint-segment"` on each segment so e2e can assert proportional widths. The NOW pin gets `data-testid="now-pin"` and `aria-label="Now 11:47"`.
- `components/BottomBar.tsx` — Voice Log button gets `aria-label="Voice Log"` (already labelled by text). The `+` button stays a no-op for this feature (modal is out of scope) but must keep `aria-label="Add"`.
- `components/AnimatedPercent.tsx` — already correct (1.6s ease-out cubic, reduced-motion respected). No change unless tests reveal a bug.

### Data model

Existing types in `lib/types.ts` are sufficient. Re-state for clarity:

```ts
type Category = "health" | "mind" | "career" | "passive";
type Brick =
  | { kind: "tick"; name: string; done: boolean }
  | {
      kind: "goal";
      name: string;
      current: number;
      target: number;
      unit?: string;
    }
  | { kind: "time"; name: string; current: number; target: number };
interface Block {
  start: string;
  end: string;
  name: string;
  category: Category;
  bricks: Brick[];
}
```

Page-1 client state:

```ts
type PageState = { blocks: Block[]; editMode: boolean };
```

**Persistence:** none in this feature. The hardcoded `BLOCKS` array seeds the client state on mount; mutations live in memory and are lost on refresh. Document this clearly so the builder does not silently introduce `localStorage`.

| Touch target floor       | `h-12` (48 px) for primary buttons; `h-9 w-9` (36 px) for TopBar buttons — **flag**: spec says ≥44px; current TopBar buttons are 36px. Increase to `h-11 w-11` (44 px) per spec. Bricks must also meet 44 px when interactive in view mode (use padded hit area). |

### Edge cases

- **Empty blocks** — `blocks.length === 0` → render `EmptyBlocks` ("No blocks yet. Tap + to add your first block.") in place of Timeline; hide BlueprintBar and NowCard. Hero `pct` shows 0.
- **Empty bricks** — block with `bricks.length === 0` → render "No bricks yet. Tap + to add a brick." inside the block; `blockPct` is 0.
- **No current block** — `currentBlockIndex` returns `-1` (e.g. NOW falls outside any block — not possible with current 24h-covering data, but possible with sparse data). Skip NowCard render; do not crash.
- **Midnight-wrapping block** (e.g. Sleep 22:00→04:00) — already handled by `duration` and `dayOffset`. Tests must include this case.
- **Reduced motion** — `AnimatedPercent` snaps to final value; CSS animations disabled by global media query. Verify in axe-only spec that no `prefers-reduced-motion` regression.
- **Long block names** — truncate with `truncate` (already done in `TimelineBlock`); verify name like "Building AI for the Apocalypse" does not overflow card.
- **Goal brick over target** (e.g. `current: 150, target: 100`) — `brickPct` caps at 100; UI shows 100%, raw `current/target` label still visible.
- **Time brick over target** — same cap behaviour.
- **Tap during edit mode** — bricks must NOT log; only the `×` affordance is active. Block tap is also a no-op (the Edit Block modal is out of scope).
- **`%` rounding** — Hero shows `Math.round`; sub-1% changes still feel responsive because `AnimatedPercent` interpolates. Verify Hero never shows `100%` unless every brick is full.
- **Locale / time format** — all times are `HH:MM` 24h; date label is hardcoded `Wed, Apr 29`. Acceptable for Page 1; flag in spec gaps.
- **Slow network / no JS** — page must render server-side first paint with the _current_ `dayPct` from `lib/dharma.ts` (so the percent number appears even before the count-up tween runs). `AnimatedPercent` is allowed to start at 0 and tween up; document this.
- **Viewport ≤ 360 px** — content must not horizontally scroll. The `max-w-[430px]` page is centered but always full-width on small screens.

### Out of scope

- Add Block modal, Edit Block modal, Add Brick modal, Block Detail screen.
- Swipe-left to delete; long-press drag-reorder; drag handles on bricks.
- Recurrence picker ("Just today / Every Monday / …").
- Copy Building / Castle flows.
- Voice Log behaviour (button is visible and labelled; tap currently no-op).
- Real persistence (localStorage / sync). State is in-memory only.
- Settings page (button is visible; tap currently no-op).
- Week / Month / Year views.
- Real-time clock — `NOW` stays the constant `"11:47"` from `lib/data.ts`.
- Editing block name/start/end inline — only the `×` icon visibility is in scope; the actual delete confirmation modal is deferred.
